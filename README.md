# Visual-Argument
My project was created on Canva, so I do not have a gimp file. Also, all of the photos are my own. My project will aim to address how older cats never get adopted over kittens.
“Older cats can make awesome, loving pets, and their personalities are known, but the vast majority of people want those tiny balls of crazy cuteness, so adult cats can waste away for months or even years before finding a home…or never find one at all. Cats live long enough these days that even a middle aged cat can give you more than a decade of companionship” -C.S. Friedman"
This is a PSA poster that would ideally be put in a ped adoption website. It includes photos of my cat Bagoonis, who I adopted as an adult. I am going to show him in all his moods to show he is a distinguished gentleman and more advanced and desirable than a kitten.
